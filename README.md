# ENPH257-Assignment-2
## Instructions:

A1. Put 10 W of thermal power into one end of a 30 cm long, 2 cm diameter aluminum rod, painted matt black. Assume the ambient temperature is a uniform 20 C, and the convection constant kc = 5 W/m2/K. In your submission, include your code and a properly labelled graph of steady-state temperature versus position on the rod.

see rod_simulation.py

A2. Estimate kc for a horizontal rod to get a better number than my guessed 5 W/m2/K. You will have to do some digging around the internet for this. Show your working and where you got the information. 

A3. Createa computer model of a Brayton Cycle and make a fully-labelled PV plot for an isentropic pressure ratio of 20. Set the ambient pressure and temperature to be 101 kPa and 10 C,  and the maximum cycle temperature to be 1000 C. Show that the area enclosed by the cycle is consistent with the theoretical efficiency formula to at least three significant figures. Make a fully-labelled plot of thermal efficiency vs. pressure ratio, showing the results of the theoretical formula as a line, and the results of your numerical calculation as “data points”.
